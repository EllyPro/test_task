1-Step
I found 3 random articles from kun.uz official website.
Parsed that with beautifulsoup library and created dataFrame with pandas library

2-Step
I created new 'word' column and used pandas str (string ) method to split() sentences into the words using " "(probel separator)

3-Step
I dont really understand that question: How often this word occured in dataset. Which "this word".

Bonus task
1. We can use telegram-bot for automating this purpose or scheduler python library that will execute same code at spefic times every day
2. Well it largely depends on situation. I think csv files or pandas dataframes are good enough for start. But for some large datas we can use SQL
or maybe NOSQL databases or something else
3. I dont really know an answer to this question
